    <h1>css box model</h1>
    <div><p>In web development, the CSS box model refers to how HTML elements are modeled in browser engines and how dimension of those HTML elements are derived from CSS properties. It is a fundamental concept for the composition of HTML webpages.[1] The guidelines of the box model are described by web standards World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) specifically the CSS Working Group. For much of late-1990s and early 2000s there had been non-standard compliant implementations of the box model in the mainstream browsers. With the advent of CSS2 in 1998, which introduced the box-sizing property, the problem had mostly been resolved.</p></div>
